! Official Forums

The new official forum for talking about ~TiddlyWiki: requests for help, announcements of new releases and plugins, debating new features, or just sharing experiences. You can participate via the associated website, or subscribe via email.

https://talk.tiddlywiki.org/

Note that talk.tiddlywiki.org is a community run service that we host and maintain ourselves. The modest running costs are covered by community contributions.

For the convenience of existing users, we also continue to operate the original ~TiddlyWiki group (hosted on Google Groups since 2005):
