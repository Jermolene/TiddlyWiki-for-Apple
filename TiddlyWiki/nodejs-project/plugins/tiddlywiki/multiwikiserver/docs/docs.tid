! HTTP API

The ~MultiWikiServer HTTP API provides access to resources hosted by the MWS store. It is based on [[the API of TiddlyWeb|https://tank.peermore.com/tanks/tiddlyweb/HTTP%20API]], first developed in 2008 by Chris Dent.

The design goals of the API are:

* To follow the principles of REST where practical
* To present resources as nouns, not verbs

General points about the design:

* In MWS there are no resources that end with / (except for the root path which is /)
